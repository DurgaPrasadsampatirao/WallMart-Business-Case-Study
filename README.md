oriented products.

Knowing that customers in the 0 - 17 age group have the lowest spending per transaction, Walmart can try to increase their spending per transaction by offering them more attractive discounts, coupons, or rewards programs. Itâ€™s essential to start building brand loyalty among younger consumers.

# 4. Customer Segmentation
Since customers in the 18 - 25, 26 - 35, and 46 - 50 age groups exhibit similar buying characteristics, and so do the customers in 36 - 45 and 55+, Walmart can optimize its product selection to cater to the preferences of these age groups.

strategies for different age groups.

# 5. Enhance the 51 - 55 Age Group Shopping Experience
Considering that customers aged 51 - 55 have the highest spending per transaction, Walmart offer them exclusive pre-sale access, special discount or provide personalized product recommendations for this age group. Walmart can also introduce loyalty programs specifically designed to reward
and retain customers in the 51 -55 age group.

After Black Friday, walmart should engage with customers who made purchases by sending followup emails or offers for related products. This can help increase customer retention and encourage repeat business throughout the holiday season and beyond.
